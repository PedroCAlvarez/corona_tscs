Main points of strategy

According to the strategy working hours in government institutions would begin from 8:00am and end at 1:00pm without any break.

Government institutions and department that direly need employees could make arrangement by introducing morning and afternoon shifts.

The strategy, however, said that employees who are focal points and their signature is needed should be present to make sure that work moves smoothly.

Government institutions had been asked to avoid gathering of more people and ensure at least one metre distance among employees in offices.

The government institutions had been advised to conduct their meetings conferences through video, voice calls and other available resources.

The ICSARC strategy sent employees ranging from 58 to 65 year old, pregnant women and women whose children are in government kindergartens on one month leave and advised them to work from home if necessary.",2020-03-22,2020-03-22,,Afghanistan,AFG,AF,National,1,,,,Restriction and Regulation of Government Services,,,This service is no longer provided by the government,Afghanistan,,,,,,All Residents (Citizen Residents + Foreign Residents),,,Mandatory (Unspecified/Implied),"National Government,Other (Please specify in the text box)",55.5128945201801,52.7407140677917,50.3510522744164,134,https://www.pajhwok.com/en/2020/03/22/corona-virus-strategy-comes-effect-facilitate-government-employees,2020-04-25,2020-04-25T05:34:05Z
