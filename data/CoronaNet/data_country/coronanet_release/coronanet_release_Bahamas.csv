R_1lmzYzGn9raKdNhCw,8721541,new_entry,original,,,"March 12, 2020- The Bahamian Ministry of Transport and Local Government announced that the Braemar cruise ship carrying five persons who have tested positive for the COVID-19 coronavirus would not be permitted to dock in The Bahamas and passengers and crew would not be allowed to disembark. 
The decision is said to have been made in the interest of protecting the health and safety of the Bahamian people.
The Bahamas Maritime Authority (BMA) was in communication with the owners of the Braemar, a Bahamas-flagged ship. The BMA reaffirmed to the Braemar, that should it arrive in Bahamian waters, The Bahamas would willingly provide humanitarian assistance. This included the possibility of  providing fuel, food, water and other supplies as needed by the vessel.
