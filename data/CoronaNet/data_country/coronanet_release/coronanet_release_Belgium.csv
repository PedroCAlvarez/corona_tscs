When a patient is tested, the doctor performing the test will ask the patient to record their contacts over the last few days.

From the middle of this week, patients infected with Covid-19 will be contacted by a call centre to ask who they have been in close contact with over the past few days. The form they filled out may be helpful during this call. People who have recently been in close contact with an infected person will also be called by the call centre. Their state of health will be assessed and, on that basis, they will be asked to take the necessary measures.

The infected patients’ general practitioner will already ask them whether they have been in close contact with certain people, such as people living in the same household. In this case, the general practitioner can issue a quarantine certificate for these people, even if the individuals concerned do not (yet) show symptoms and are fit for work. Individuals who have been issued with such a quarantine certificate must comply with the isolation measures. They can, however, work from home.

Last weekend, the distribution of the first batch of test kits started along with all the necessary material. A total of 11,000 kits are being distributed in Flanders, 7,000 in Wallonia and 2,000 in Brussels. Each of the three regions drew up a list of institutions that should receive test kits as a matter of priority.
After delivery, the residential care centres and retirement and nursing homes can take a sample from their residents and their staff. These samples are then collected and transferred to the laboratory so that the results for each institution are available as quickly as possible. Each institution will therefore clearly be able to see how many COVID-19 infections there are and the necessary measures can be taken quickly.",2020-04-10,2020-04-10,,Belgium,BEL,BE,National,0,,,Health Testing,Other Health Testing,,"",Belgium,,,,,,,,,Mandatory (Unspecified/Implied),"National Government,Ministry/Department of Health,Provincial/State Government,New (COVID-19 specific) Task Force",51.1909192583514,46.7051936754418,42.2019216520814,3,https://www.info-coronavirus.be/en/news/tests-residential-care-centres/,2020-12-03,2020-12-03T11:14:42Z

An initiative to increase the number of daily coronavirus tests was launched last week by Digital Minister Philippe de Backer and Health Minister Maggie De Block.
“We follow a strategy to progressively increase the number of tests from 2,000 to 10,000 per day,” De Backer wrote in an online statement.
Currently, the official guidelines on testing dictate that only medical staff and hospitalised patients with apparent symptoms should be tested.

Alternatively, he can also refer his patients to a triage centre set up by a circle of general practitioners, which will have testing facilities in place and organised itself for this purpose.
