The result, according to FVS-AM, shows that the percentage of contaminated follows the average recorded in the first week, in tests by other professionals, such as in the areas of safety (36%) and health (38%), which subsequently presented rate reduction.

The results of the rapid tests, the active surveillance work with education professionals and the epidemiological situation of Covid-19 in Amazonas were presented, this Friday afternoon (08/21), by the president-director of FVS-AM, Rosemary da Costa Pinto, to representatives of the Public Prosecutor's Office (MPE) and Federal (MPF), the Public Prosecutor's Office (MPT) and the Public Defender's Office (DPE), in addition to the Union of Workers in Education (Sinteam).

Rapid tests for education professionals began to be carried out by the Government of Amazonas last Tuesday. In three days, 534 professionals were tested, of which 162 were positive, of which 139 had positive IGM and IGG, which indicates that, although they already have antibodies to Covid-19, the virus remains active. As established in the protocol for resuming face-to-face classes, professionals who tested positive were removed for the necessary isolation period.
