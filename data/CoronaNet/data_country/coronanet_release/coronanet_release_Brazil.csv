In addition, the city also reported that it suspended, on average, 60% of the entire public transport system by bus in Belém as a preventive measure to covid-19. 

“The suspension of the BRT, together with the reduction in the bus fleet in the city, can directly damage the population, such as, for example, the increase in the capacity of the collective, the accumulation of people at the stops and inside the vehicles, in addition to the worsening in the service provided ”, added the attorney general.
