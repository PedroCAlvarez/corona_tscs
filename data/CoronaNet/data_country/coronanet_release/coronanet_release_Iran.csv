Mohammad-Javad Haj Ali-Akbar, Chairman of the Friday Prayers Policy-Making Council, on Wednesday made the cancellation announcement and said the decision was made in compliance with the Coronavirus Combat Task Force.

The Council draws guidelines for the sermons delivered in more than 600 locations across the country after the prayers every week. The members of the Council are appointed by the Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.

According to Haj Ali-Akbar prayers are cancelled in all province capitals but in other cities a committee consisting of the representative of the Supreme Leader, governor and the director-general of the city will make a decision whether to allow the prayers to be held or not.

Some influential clerics such as Ahmad Alam ol-Hoda, Friday Prayer Leader of Mashhad, and Mohammad Saeedi, Custodian of Masoumeh Shrine in Qom, had strongly opposed cancellation of communal prayers and closing shrines.""",2020-02-26,2020-02-28,2020-05-04,Iran,IRN,IR,National,1,,,,Restrictions of Mass Gatherings,,,,Iran,,,,,,All Residents (Citizen Residents + Foreign Residents),,,Mandatory (Unspecified/Implied),"National Government,Other (Please specify in the text box)",52.4344555884816,51.6125842332348,50.6231391503598,183,https://en.radiofarda.com/a/iran-cancels-friday-prayers-again-due-to-coronavirus/30469021.html,2020-04-01,2020-04-01T18:05:47Z

Mohammad-Javad Haj Ali-Akbar, Chairman of the Friday Prayers Policy-Making Council, on Wednesday made the cancellation announcement and said the decision was made in compliance with the Coronavirus Combat Task Force.

The Council draws guidelines for the sermons delivered in more than 600 locations across the country after the prayers every week. The members of the Council are appointed by the Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.

According to Haj Ali-Akbar prayers are cancelled in all province capitals but in other cities a committee consisting of the representative of the Supreme Leader, governor and the director-general of the city will make a decision whether to allow the prayers to be held or not.

Some influential clerics such as Ahmad Alam ol-Hoda, Friday Prayer Leader of Mashhad, and Mohammad Saeedi, Custodian of Masoumeh Shrine in Qom, had strongly opposed cancellation of communal prayers and closing shrines.""
