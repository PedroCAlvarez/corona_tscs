R_4SYnEjOFwIFVy8NNA,5116804,update,original,Change of Policy,Relaxing,"On the 17th of December 2020, the Italian region of Veneto announced a policy to restrict the movement of people in the region.

Starting from the 19th of December, it is forbidden to move to a Venetian municipality (comune), other than that of residence or home, after 2pm. Exceptions apply to proven work/study needs, health reasons and/or situations of emergency. The policy specifies that after 2pm, it is always allowed to return to the address of residence or home address.

People who need to travel to a municipality that differs from that of residence, must provide a self-declaration (autocertificazione) to motivate their reason of travel. Failure to declare reasons of travel motivated by proven work/study needs, situations of necessity or urgency, or health reasons, will result in sections.

Further exceptions apply to:
- travel between municipalities to attend weddings and funerals
- travel to reach children and minors who are staying with parents, or foster parent
- travel to reach launderettes, hairdressers, health centers, beauticians or other personal services

The policy is set to last until the 6th of January 2021, unless the government decides on further national restrictions that would therefore terminate this regional policy. UPDATE: The original travel restriction policy was set to last until the 6th of January 2021. However, the Italian government imposed a policy that would implement a national 'red zone', with further and stronger travel restrictions. Therefore, this regional policy terminated on the 23rd December 2020 when the national policy was imposed.",2020-12-17,2020-12-19,2021-12-23,Italy,ITA,IT,Provincial,1,Veneto,IT-34,,Internal Border Restrictions,,,,Italy,,,,,,,,Not Applicable,Mandatory with Exceptions (Please list exceptions in the text entry),Provincial/State Government,,,,,NA,2020-12-22,2020-12-22T11:22:56Z
