They are based on the law of 3 April 2020 on an aid scheme for businesses in temporary difficulty and amending the amended Law of 19 December 2014 on 1) social measures for the benefit of independent professional artists and workers in the entertainment industry without regular employment, and 2) the promotion of artistic creation.

This repayable financial aid is intended for use by:

commercial, craft or industrial businesses:
that hold a business permit;
are not active in an excluded sector;
If a business has mixed activities (both excluded and eligible sectors), only its eligible activities are covered by aid, on condition that the activities or their costs are kept separate;
in which the employer has not been convicted at least twice for clandestine work or employment of illegally resident non-EU citizens (exclusion for a duration of 3 years from the judgement date);
 
natural or legal persons who:
established in Luxembourg, and;
carry out as their main activity and in a self-employed capacity one of the following activities:
a scientific, artistic or literary activity;
a teaching or educational activity;
the professional activity of doctors, dentists, veterinary surgeons, midwives, physiotherapists, masseurs;
lawyers, notaries, bailiffs, executors of wills;
trustees, chartered accountants, tax consultants;

EXCLUDED SECTORS
The following sectors/types of aid are excluded:

the fishery and aquaculture sectors as defined in Regulation (EU) No 1379/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2013;
the sector of the primary production of agricultural products;
the sector of the transformation and sale of agricultural products where:
the amount of the aid is fixed on the basis of the price or quantity of products of this type purchased from primary producers or put on the market by the businesses concerned;
the aid is conditional on being partly or fully passed on to the primary producers;
the types of aid in favour of businesses that were in difficulty before 1 January 2020 in accordance with Article 2(18) of Regulation (EU) No 651/2014.
A """"business in difficulty"""" refers to any undertaking that fulfils at least one of the following conditions:
if it is a limited liability company (SARL, SA or SCA) other than an SME that has been in existence for at least 3 years, when over half of its subscribed share capital has been lost due to accumulated losses.
This is the case when deduction of accumulated losses from reserves (and all other elements generally considered as part of the company's own funds) leads to a negative cumulative amount that exceeds half of the subscribed share capital; or
in the case of a company where at least some members have unlimited liability for the debt of the company (partnerships or limited partnerships) other than an SME that has been in existence for less than 3 years, where more than half of its own capital as shown in the company accounts has been lost due to accumulated losses; or
if the business has been subject to collective insolvency proceedings or fulfils the criteria under Luxembourg law for being placed in collective insolvency proceedings at the request of its creditors; or
