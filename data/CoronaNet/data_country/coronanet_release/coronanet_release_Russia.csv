On a daily basis, specialists from insurance companies contact insured residents of Orenburg who are at risk. They inform citizens over the age of 60 about the need to comply with the self-isolation regime, the main symptoms caused by the coronavirus, and also remind them of useful hotlines.

Insurance representatives also talk about how to get help from volunteers to deliver food and medicine to people in self-isolation. With the consent of the residents of Orenburg, insurance representatives themselves transfer their contact details to the volunteer headquarters for communication.

The Orenburg branch of the insurance medical organization ""Capital MS"" together with the All-Russian People's Front helps the elderly and those who have found themselves in a difficult life situation. Insurance representatives buy grocery baskets and deliver them to citizens' homes in compliance with all epidemiological standards.

One of the main types of fraud is phishing. Its purpose is to obtain logins, passwords, credit card details by forging messages from a trusted source. Phishing pages on the Internet are very similar to the original ones.
To avoid receiving phishing messages, the first thing to do is set up your mail. Disable preview, set up spam filters, enable two-factor authentication on your inbox. Second, look for the refresh button of your browser to install the latest up-to-date version and enable the anti-phishing option. Third, update your antivirus databases. Install security software on all computer equipment with which you access the Internet. Manufacturers provide some versions of antivirus software for free or with a grace period.
Do not open or download email attachments from unknown or questionable recipients. Check the data in the message from several sources. Remember, no real employee has the right to demand information on a bank card, logins and passwords from you.
