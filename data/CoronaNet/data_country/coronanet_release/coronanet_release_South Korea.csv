KCDC reminded everyone that COVID-19 is an infectious disease that can affect anyone and that infection shouldn’t be grounds for blame or social stigma. The KCDC asked citizens to send warm regards and encouragement to those who are affected by the virus, including confirmed patients and their families, people under self-quarantine, and recovered patients. Excess blame can cause patients to suffer the aftermath of psychological trauma even after recovering from the infection. Such a culture can potentially result in people refusing to be tested for the fear of social stigma, causing in turn more infection to spread to local communities. The transparent, timely disclosure of infection-related information is provided for the purpose of infection prevention only, as it helps to find potential cases unable to be traced by epidemiological investigation by informing those who may have been exposed to the virus. The KCDC asked reporters and others to refrain from citing or reporting on privacy-sensitive information or information that can identify the patient.""",2020-03-20,2020-03-20,,South Korea,KOR,KR,National,0,,,,Public Awareness Measures,Disseminating information related to COVID-19 to the public that is reliable and factually accurate,,,South Korea,,,,,,,,,Voluntary/Recommended but No Penalties,"National Government,Ministry/Department of Health",54.9245569200058,51.05051535016,47.498882538757,60,https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=a30402000000&bid=0030&tag=&act=view&list_no=366611,2020-08-15,2020-08-15T13:26:36Z
