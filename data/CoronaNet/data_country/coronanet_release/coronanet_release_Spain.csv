R_3m4dbD3QwCfoWWONA,7366420,update,original,End of Policy,,"On April 28, the Prime Minister of Spain announced that, beginning May 4, the nation would enter a gradual de-escalation period for the country's strict lockdown. As the de-escalation will take place ""at a different, yet coordinated, rate"" in each province, the severity of curfew restrictions per province largely depends on that particular environment, meaning the beginning of this plan therefore replaces the national curfew restrictions preceding it. (Additionally, due to the province-centric characteristic of the de-escalation measure, all advancements in the plan will be coded sub-nationally for each individual province.)

 UPDATE: On June 21, the national state of alarm is lifted therefore ending the de-escalation plan.
