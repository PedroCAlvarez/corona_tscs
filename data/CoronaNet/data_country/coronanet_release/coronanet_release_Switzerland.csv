Visits to acute hospitals are still prohibited. In certain cases the management can authorize visits. Publicly accessible restaurants or cafeterias of acute hospitals remain closed to outside parties while the ones of the psychiatries and nursing homes are allowed to open with a protection concept.

Rehabilitation clinics and nursing homes allow controlled visit if the clinic/ home management considers relaxation based on the patient population and the current situation to be justifiable. Otherwise the regulation applies analogously to the acute hospitals.
The publicly accessible restaurants or cafeterias are allowed to open with a protection concept, provided that the rehabilitation clinic management considers the opening to be reasonable due to the patient population and the current situation.
There is still a basic ban on visits in nursing homes, with exceptions that the management can approve e.g. relatives can visit a dying person.

It takes over the case management and assistance in accordance with the legal requirements applicable in its municipality, if this one is not able to fulfill its duties another appropriate body takes over.
The original municipality has to bear the expenses incurred by the newly responsible institution.
The cantonal social service can take appropriate coordination measures and regulate uniform criteria for assuming responsibility in an instruction.

Requests for the granting of cost credits for medical purposes that do not tolerate a delay are to be treated as appropriate and the associated payments as quickly as possible to do.
