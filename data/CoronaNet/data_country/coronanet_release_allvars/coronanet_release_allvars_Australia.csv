On the 21 April 2020, the National Cabinet agreed that from 27 April 2020, category 2 and some important category 3 procedures can recommence across the public and private hospital sectors. These include IVF; screening programs (cancer and other diseases); post cancer reconstruction procedures (such as breast reconstruction); procedures for children under 18 years of age; joint replacements (including knees, hips, shoulders); cataracts and eye procedures; and endoscopy and colonoscopy procedures.

On 15 May 2020, the Australian National Cabinet announced that it is considered safe to reopen elective surgery activity in an incremental and cautious way, while maintaining necessary ICU capacity for any localised outbreaks of COVID-19. The reopening will involve 3 stages.

Stage 1 – up to 50 per cent of normal surgical activity levels (including reportable and non-reportable);
Stage 2 – up to 75 per cent of normal surgical activity levels (including reportable and non-reportable);
Stage 3 – up to 100 per cent of normal surgical activity levels (including reportable and non-reportable) or as close to normal activity levels as is safely possible. UPDATE: On the 25 March 2020, all non urgent elective surgery was suspended. The original policy was relaxed on 27 April 2020 and certain procedures recommenced. On 15 May 2020, the National Cabinet announced that it is now considered safe to reopen elective surgery activity in an incremental and cautious way, while maintaining necessary ICU capacity for any localised outbreaks of COVID-19.",2020-05-15,2020-05-15,,Australia,AUS,AU,National,0,,,,Health Resources,Hospitals,,,Australia,"One or more countries, but not all countries",,,,,All Residents (Citizen Residents + Foreign Residents),Inbound,Not Applicable,Mandatory (Unspecified/Implied),"National Government,Ministry/Department of Health",,,,,NA ; https://www.pm.gov.au/media/update-coronavirus-measures-15may20,2020-07-29,2020-07-29T14:20:55Z,7035,98,6359,40336,983816,38.581,,,,,,19,1602,2,1,,0.669777811,-0.20141026,2,79,23789752,1.30102e+12,54688.4459,2.240028575,16.9847654,27.8941732,10.9094077,2,2,2.376707315,-0.69428573,483374,0.8868968

The new directions increased the maximum number of people in a place to 80 ( with a limit of 20 to any one room or enclosed space).

On 18 March 2020, the National Cabinet followed up on this advice by affirming that outdoor events of fewer than 500 attendees may proceed. However, general measures should be implemented that include:

In a given occupied space, there must be no more than one person per four square metres of ground space and; 
Availability of hand hygiene products and suitable waste receptacles, with frequent cleaning and waste disposal.

Food markets are exempt from the 500 person limit, however must undertake additional measures, such as control of patronage level numbers or stall density reduction to decrease the risk of COVID-19 transmission.

There may be other gatherings that are considered essential and it is at the discretion of the individual state and territory Chief Medical Officers or equivalent to assess each on their merits, and determine whether they can continue if mitigated by social distancing measures. UPDATE: In the original entry, the Australian government issued advice regarding outdoor gatherings that was recorded as 'voluntary/recommended' in nature.

Visitors and staff who have returned from overseas in the last 14 days; been in contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19 in the last 14 days; with fever or symptoms of acute respiratory infection (e.g. cough, sore throat, runny nose, shortness of breath); and who have not been vaccinated against influenza (after 1 May) are restricted from entering the facilities. 

Furthermore, visits should be limited to a short duration; a maximum of two immediate social supports (family members, close friends) or professional service or advocacy at one time, per day; be conducted in a resident’s room, outdoors, or in a specific area designated by the aged care facility, rather than communal areas where the risk of transmission to residents is greater. There must be no large group visits or gatherings, including social activities or entertainment, should be permitted at this time; and no school groups of any size should be allowed to visit aged care facilities.

Visitors should also be encouraged to practise social distancing practices where possible, including maintaining a distance of 1.5 metres. Children aged 16 years or less must be permitted only by exception, as they are generally unable to comply with hygiene measures. Exemptions can be assessed on a case-by-case basis, for example, where the resident is in a palliative care scenario. Measures such as phone or video calls must be accessible to all residents to enable more regular communication with family members.
