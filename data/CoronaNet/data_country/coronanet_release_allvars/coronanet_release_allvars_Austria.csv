The admission of visitor groups outdoors is now attached to conditions. They may be admitted if consisting of 12 persons at the maximum (in addition to up to 6 underage children of theirs or minors for whom they have the responsibility) or exclusively from the same household (both these changes are slated to end on November 22). The consumption of alcoholic drinks after closing time is now prohibited within 50 metres of catering industry facilities. The consumption of meals and drinks when not sitting at prescribed places of serving is now generally prohibited except at outdoor food stalls. Face covering is now generally mandatory for operators/employees whenever there is costumer contact and appropriate safeguards for social distancing are not available and costumers whenever not at their seat. Exceptions are extended and now also include homes for those with disabilities. The facilities exempted from catering industry provisions (outside of mass transportation facilities) are now only discharged from opening hour and closing time provisions (§§ 2 and 2a of the source document).
