Runners are only allowed to leave the country once a week using a commercial vehicle.

All transported goods must be kept or quarantined for three days at transport operators’ premises before they can be delivered to customers.

Transport operators and runners are also required to update their health status daily through the self-assessment tool on healthinfo.gov.bn for 14 days after their cross-border travel.
