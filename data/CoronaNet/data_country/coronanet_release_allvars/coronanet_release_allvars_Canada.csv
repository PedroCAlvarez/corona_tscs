“As we continue to respond to COVID-19 together, we must ensure there are services in place to support those who are most vulnerable including people experiencing homelessness,” said Stefanson. “These investments will help ensure trusted community-based organizations can extend or expand their supports, so everyone has a safe place when they need it.”
 
This builds on a $1.2-million investment for homeless shelters announced in April and will support:
• expanded capacity at a Main Street Project (MSP) location on Disraeli Street in Winnipeg for the next three months, providing space for 180 beds every night ($135,000);
• continued operation of a site on Sargent Avenue in Winnipeg, which has 39 beds for individuals who may need to self-isolate due to COVID-19, to be managed by MSP until the end of September ($242,000); and
• ongoing operations of the Salvation Army’s Winnipeg Centre of Hope, as a need to decrease its capacity to meet physical distancing requirements has resulted in financial challenges ($360,000).",2020-06-26,2020-07-26,NA,"Canada","CAN","CA","Provincial",0,"Manitoba",NA,"Health Resources","Masks",NA,"","Canada",NA,NA,"Manitoba",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Voluntary/Recommended but No Penalties","Provincial/State Government",NA,NA,NA,NA,"https://news.gov.mb.ca/news/index.html?item=48517&posted=2020-06-26",2020-07-03,"2020-07-03 10:45:47"
