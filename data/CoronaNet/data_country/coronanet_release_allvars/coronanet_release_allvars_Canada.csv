The superintendent of the largest district in B.C., Jordan Tinney, explained that secondary students in Grades 10-12 will only have 30 peers in their cohort and students in Grades 8 and 9 will have 60. B.C. students will be back in class by Sept. 10. To help with this, Surrey secondary schools will implement staggered start, break and dismissal times to limit hallway interactions. The district plan also included controlled traffic flow, regular hand-washing, and enhanced cleaning of buildings.
