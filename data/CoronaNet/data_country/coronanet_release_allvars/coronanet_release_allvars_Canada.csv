People can now gather in groups of up to 10 without physical distancing. People in a group are not required to be exclusive but they are strongly encouraged to maintain a consistent group. This is especially important for Nova Scotians who are more at risk of complications from COVID-19. This change replaces the concept of family household bubbles.

Gatherings of up to 50 will now be allowed but people must observe physical distancing of two metres or six feet.

The larger gathering limit of 50 applies to social events, faith gatherings, sports and physical activity, weddings and funerals, and arts and culture events like theatre performances, dance recitals, festivals and concerts.",2020-03-17,2020-03-17,,Canada,CAN,CA,Provincial,1,Nova Scotia,,,Restrictions of Mass Gatherings,,,,Canada,,,,,,All Residents (Citizen Residents + Foreign Residents),,,Mandatory (Unspecified/Implied),"Provincial/State Government,Police",52.4485609194223,51.5907130368405,50.6547731613186,99,NA,2020-06-22,2020-06-22T08:46:02Z,478,6,9,6446,44205,1.171,,,,,,22,1653,,,,0.008078967,0.738691926,0,82,35848610,1.7963e+12,50108.065,0.941675857,17.3948153,28.2167526,10.8219372,2,2,2.447638273,0.92336033,1307417,0.88183355
