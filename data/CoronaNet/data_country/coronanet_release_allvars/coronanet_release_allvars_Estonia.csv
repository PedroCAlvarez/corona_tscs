As of tomorrow, 29. August, the police will restrict late-night alcohol sales in Harjumaa. By order of the head of the North prefecture, retail sale of alcoholic beverages will be restricted in Harju County from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. The restriction will remain in force until further notice, but it is currently estimated to be a short-term restriction, the duration of which depends on the attitude and behaviour of people and their compliance with the requirement of dispersion. The Police and Border Guard Board and the Health Board will re-evaluate the relevance of the restriction once a week.

“According to the Health Board, in Estonia, the risk for the spread of the infection is the highest in Tallinn due to large population and high population density. As of this morning, there are 61 active cases in Harju County, and the Health Board estimates that some of the infected persons contracted the virus directly or indirectly at an entertainment facility where it is common to consume alcoholic beverages.",2020-08-28,2020-08-29,,Estonia,EST,EE,Provincial,1,Harjumaa,EE-37,,Restriction and Regulation of Businesses,Other Businesses,,"This type of business  (""Other Businesses"") is allowed to open with conditions",Estonia,One or more provinces within a country,,Harjumaa,,,All Residents (Citizen Residents + Foreign Residents),,,Mandatory (Unspecified/Implied),"Police,Other (Please specify in the text box)",,,,,https://www.kriis.ee/en/news/police-will-restrict-late-night-alcohol-sales-tartu-harju-polva-valga-and-voru-counties,2020-09-02,2020-09-02T15:35:56Z,2363,64,2086,810,174023,131.186,,,,,,12,1355,0,2,-0.82478433,0.379635602,-0.20141026,0,70,1314608,23141668874,17603.4748,1.444213103,14.089049,23.8649006,9.77585159,2,2,2.491454363,,186281,0.9018862
