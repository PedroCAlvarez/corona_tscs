The city ""reminds individuals that there does not currently exist any vaccine, food, air purifier, lamp, dietary supplement, or any other product that protects from or cures COVID 19."" The announcement also reminded readers that ""COVID 19 tests are carried out by health authorities via medical prescription. No other organization or individual is allowed to process these tests.""
The announcement warns that purchasing paracetamol online is illegal, and warns against scams of home decontamination procedures, stating that ""no home decontamination procedures are scheduled by the government at this time.
