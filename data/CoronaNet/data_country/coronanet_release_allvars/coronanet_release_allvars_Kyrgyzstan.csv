UPD: Boarding houses and resting houses in Issyk-Kul will begin to accept from June 1. The government advises citizens to go on vacation to the Issyk-Kul region by passenger cars, as there is a high risk of contracting coronavirus in buses and minibusses, First Deputy Prime Minister Kubatbek Boronov said at a briefing. According to him, the decision was made taking into account the appeals and questions of citizens. Boronov noted that the government advises Kyrgyzstanis to travel on vacation in private cars, rather than in buses and minibusses, since when 50 or more citizens gather in transport, there is a risk of contracting coronavirus. “If you decide to go by bus in an organized manner, then you must comply with all sanitary standards when you are in public transport,” explained Boronov. UPDATE: The original policy forced boarding houses in Issyk-Kul to be quarantined, meaning not allowing any guests and visitors to come. The new update states that from June 1, boarding houses are allowed to resume their work.",2020-03-20,2020-03-20,2020-06-01,Kyrgyzstan,KGZ,KG,Provincial,1,Issyk-Kul,,,Restriction and Regulation of Businesses,Other Businesses,,"This type of business  (""Other Businesses"") is closed/locked down",Kyrgyzstan,One or more provinces within a country,,Issyk-Kul,,,All Residents (Citizen Residents + Foreign Residents),,,Mandatory (Unspecified/Implied),New (COVID-19 specific) Task Force,53.9349116663081,52.9374618638921,52.2440458673027,149,NA ; https://ru.sputnik.kg/society/20200529/1048479809/kyrgyzstan-issyk-kul-pansionat-dom-pansionat-otdykha.html,2020-12-23,2020-12-23T21:32:10Z,6,0,0,,,,,,,,,89,3092,1,1,0.107444331,0.992205441,-0.20141026,12,28,5956900,6059145538,1017.16421,3.469281026,15.6000607,22.5248346,6.92477385,0,1,-0.07057673,,718186,0.50698874
