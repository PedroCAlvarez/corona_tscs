Government announces voluntary repatriation assistance scheme for all foreign nationals

The Maltese Government is now extending the call to all foreign nationals, who either resided or who were here on a temporary visit, and who wish to be repatriated to their home country.
Assistance is also available to European Union citizens and third-country nationals who have been staying in Malta for different purposes such as employment, education and family reasons, among others. Foreign individuals who are not in possession of a residence document are also entitled to assistance.
These individuals are being asked to register their interest to utilise one of these repatriation flights by Sunday 19th April 2020.
These flights, especially ones outside of Europe, are heavily subsidized by the Maltese Government as a form of assistance to all foreign individuals on a humanitarian basis.
This scheme is a voluntary one and the Government extends its support to all those individuals, irrespective of nationality, insofar that if they lose their employment or job they will be aided as per earlier notifications.
