 Rules and guidelines for walking and outdoor leisure and shopping and city life:

Start your walk from home and do not use public transport or packed carparks.
Use your local neighbourhood, and avoid the most popular spots.
Give each other enough space, at least 2 metres; the forest has room for all of us!
Vary the time of day when you start your walks.
Keep a safe distance when you pass others, nod and say Â«helloÂ», itâ€™s the best way to go!
Try not to head for a particular goal, but rather walk where there are less people and find your own footpath.
Bring your own sandwiches. Food tastes best outdoors.
Take your rubbish home with you. Whatever you take into the forest, you should bring it all back.
Please respect the ban on open fires, which lasts from 15 April until 15 September. Only the use of authorised sites for bonfires and barbecues will be allowed during this period.
Remember to keep a safe distance, also when you meet people you know. 

Shopping and City Life:
The most important rules to avoid crowding in shops and streets:
-Make use of the all the shopsâ€™ opening hours. If possible, do your shopping in the early morning or late evening.
-If the shop is full of people, find another shop or come back later.
-Keep a safe distance in the streets and avoid places where there are crowds.
-Avoid unnecessary trips in the City.
-Do not use public transport if you donâ€™t have to.
-Parties, dinner parties and other gatherings can wait. Remember that only five people can be together at a safe distance.
-Parks, sports grounds and training areas can be used as long as everyone keeps a safe distance and no more than five people are together.
