Priority is given to those working in essential services such as healthcare, transport and waste management, so that operations in these sectors are not compromised, he added.
Other factors the ministry considers include whether employers have arranged for suitable housing for returning workers to serve the mandatory 14-day leave of absence (LOA), and the need to stagger the entry of workers to ""manage their return in an orderly manner"".

The ministry had announced last Friday that all work pass holders with travel history to mainland China in the last 14 days need to get its approval three days before their planned entry into Singapore.

The ministry would give an approval letter, which the worker must show to airline staff at check-in and at the immigration checkpoint when they arrive in Singapore.

Those with an even last digit can only visit these markets on the even dates of the month, and those with an odd last digit can only visit these markets on the odd dates of the month.

Effective 13 August this odd/even restriction has been lifted for shopping on weekdays but will remain in place on weekends.
