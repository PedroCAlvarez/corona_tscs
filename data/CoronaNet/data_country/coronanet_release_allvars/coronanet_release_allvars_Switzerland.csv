In Switzerland, the state council of the canton of Zurich decided at the 19th of march that the exams from the 25th of march will be moved to a later date because of the big numbers of candidates the health measures can’t be met, that’s why the oral exams and the creative aptitude tests will not take place.  This leads to adjustments of the admission procedure in middle schools and specialized middle school for the school year 2020/2021. For the admission, the result of the written examination will be decisive for pupils, according to the applicable admission regulations would have to take the oral exam. These pupils will be provisional accepted to the probationary period. The design aptitude tests for the K + S classes and the Liceo artisto will be exclusively based on the handed in documents of the candidates.

The app is expected to be tested by employees of the Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology in Lausanne and Zurich, by members of the armed forces and employees of hospitals as well as the federal and cantonal administrations. 
The parliament decided this week (May 5) that a legal basis must be created before the launch of the App. To this end, the Federal Council will amend the Epidemics Act accordingly and submit an urgent message to be adopted by parliament
The app is designed to help break chains of infection. With the app, potentially infected people can be warned at an early stage and the spread of the virus can be contained without compromising their privacy. Use of the app is voluntary. No personal data or location details of the app users are used. All data in the app are continuously deleted after 21 days.
